I'm doing reviews for my preliminary exam in Feb lately. Below are two main topics that will be involved in the exam.

- Computer Systems and Software
- Digital System Design

Therefore, I will save the notes and records made during my learning process on this webpage. On one hand, this will help deepen my understanding of the knowledge; on the other hand, it will make it easier for me to review it in the future. I may also continue to save my study notes on this webpage after my exam.
